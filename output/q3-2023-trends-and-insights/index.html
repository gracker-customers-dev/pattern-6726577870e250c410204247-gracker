<p>In Q3 2023, global GDP growth displayed a mixed picture, with some economies rebounding strongly while others struggled with ongoing challenges. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported an average growth rate of approximately 3.5%, driven by robust consumer spending in developed markets and improved manufacturing output in emerging economies.
